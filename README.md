# Simulating-DSDV-Protocol-to-understand-end-to-end-delay-and-packet-delivery-ratio
The major objective of the project was to simulate the DSDV protocol to understand the packet delivery ratio and end to end delay with varying the number of nodes available.

From the output obtained it was observed that as the number of nodes increased the end to end delay also increased and the packet delivery ratio decreases
